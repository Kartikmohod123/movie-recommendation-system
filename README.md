🎬 Movie Recommendation System
This is a content-based movie recommendation system built using Python and machine learning techniques. It suggests similar movies based on a selected movie's features such as genres, overview, cast, crew, and keywords.

📁 Project Overview
This project leverages the TMDb 5000 Movies Dataset, which includes information about:

Movie metadata (tmdb_5000_movies.csv)

Credits (cast and crew) (tmdb_5000_credits.csv)

Using natural language processing (NLP) and similarity techniques like cosine similarity, the model recommends movies that are contextually close to the selected one.

🗃 Dataset
Note:
Due to GitHub's file size limits, the datasets tmdb_5000_movies.csv and tmdb_5000_credits.csv are not uploaded directly to this repository.

You can download them manually from Kaggle:
